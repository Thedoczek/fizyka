		<h2>Frequency and period</h2>
		<p>
			Frequency (f) is the number of cycles of a sound wave occuring in one second.
			It's measured in Hertz (Hz). We perceive this as a change of the sound's pitch.
			The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch.
			If the frequency doubles, we will hear the sound an octave higher.<br>
			Period (T) is inversed frequency - it describes length of one period, in seconds (s).
			The longer the period, the lower the pitch.
		</p>
		<h2>Amplitude</h2>
		<p>
			Amplitude (A) is the largest displacement of the particles from the rest position.
			We perceive that as a change of the sound's loudness. The larger the amplitude, the louder the sound. In sound, it is measured in decibels (dB),
			however different units describing displacement or pressure can be used for other types of waves.
		</p>
		<h2>Wavelength</h2>
		<p>
			Wavelength (Î») describes the distance between two corresponding points of a consecutive cycles. It is measured in meters (m).
			It is directly proportional to the period and inversely proportional to frequency.
		</p>
		<h2>Wave speed</h2>
		<p>
			Wave speed (v) describes the speed at which a wave travels through a medium. It is measured in meters per second (m/s) and is related to the medium's properties.<br>
